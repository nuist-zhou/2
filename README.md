## ✨ 简介
BrailleTrans-MoE is an innovative Chinese-to-braille translation system specifically designed to address the limitations of traditional translation methods when dealing with complex linguistic phenomena in Chinese.

Braille, as the primary medium for the visually impaired to access information, requires precise conversion from Chinese text—a critical technological component in advancing information accessibility. However, conventional translation approaches face significant challenges in disambiguating Chinese homophones and handling complex word segmentation rules, making it difficult to meet the practical demands for high accuracy and robustness.
